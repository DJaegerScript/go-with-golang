# Preliminary 🙌

So, this is my own documentation when I started learning Go Lang 😎 and this repository is the complementary of my blog writing 👌. So, that when you read my blog, you may clone this repository to prove any source code that I attached on my writing 😁. 

I hope you enjoy and understand this repository, __Happy Coding__ 👊😎✌
